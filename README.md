We make use of the data of ‘British army deaths during the late war with Russia’[1] .Since the data is available in tabular format, we first process and convert it into JSON dataset format. Subsequently, we make use of the p5.js processing language. 

In the coxcomb chart, the arcs drawn which form a ‘pie’, represents deaths for each month. Different colors depict various reasons for deaths of the British Army. Color yellow shows deaths due to Zymotic Diseases, color red shows deaths due to wounds, and color black show deaths due to other reasons.

From the figure, we conclude that most of the British soldiers died due to Zymotic diseases and not because of wound or other reasons. Further, we can also notice that the deaths due to Zymotic diseases only started decreasing after June 1855.
